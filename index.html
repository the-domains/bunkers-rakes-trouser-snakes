</picture><p>I use the term slumming it affectionately because I enjoy my time on the ADT - It's what I call real golf and makes you appreciate the luxuries of the main tour. I've also made some really good friends among the players, caddies and tournament staff.</p><p>Most ADT events are played Wednesday to Saturday which means that you have to arrive on the Monday and use it as a practice day. This week was no different, so a 415am alarm to make sure we caught the 521am train from Putrajaya to KLIA2 to catch our 730am
    Air Asia flight to Langkawi. Quick 45 minute flight to the holiday island, taxi to the course and we're hitting balls on the range by 10am. 18 hole practice round, 530pm bus back to the official hotel (The Bayview - nice hotel but out of our price
    range), 10 minute walk to our recommended hotel ( the person shall remain nameless given we christened our hotel 'The Shitin", dump the bags, out for a quick dinner and flat out, well Pugh was by 830pm). A pretty long day but it's the norm, you do
    get used to it and become expert at grabbing little naps whenever you can to catch up on sleep.</p><p>The hotel room, was shall we say cosy (ie not much room to swing a cat) but it's another example of my earlier post about not everything being luxurious in the world of golf</p><p>Practicing at the range at some ADT events can be a little haphazard. At the majority of ranges you can't hit driver (like this week even though it was 302 yards uphill to the end of the range), the odd course doesn't even have a range (Impian GC). The
    general standard of practice balls also leaves a lot to be desired (see pic below on the left) but at least the RM7 the players had to fork out each day this week was for pretty decent Srixon range balls. Again at someNow Malaysia is hot and humid
    at the best of times but at present it's suffering a mini heatwave in the north of the country so I find it rather bizarre that on the practice days there is nowhere to buy drinks between hole 1 and 9 and hole 10 to 18. I can understand sticking with
    the rules about only giving 3 free bottles of water to each player/caddie however what was mystifying was the lack of anywhere on course to stock up. Pretty sure the guys would have been happy to pay for the extra water and the club could have made
    some more money. I'm pretty sure the tournament organisers have a duty of care to participants to look after them ( one player was suffering severe dehydration/cramps late on Monday afternoon). Is it going to take a death to make people see common
    sense? The other gripe was the litter that was left around the course by my family caddies (some of these pictures were taken less than 10 paces from a litter bin). I'm sorry it's just lazy to simply dump the empty bottles anywhere, the sooner the
    Tour fines a few litter louts the $100 designated amount the better!!</p><p>Players on the ADT and a lot of the mini tours contrary to popular belief don't make a lot of money. I've randomly picked a golfer who finished in the top 20 who picked up just short of $600 US (RM2,200) in prize money. Lets say his flight to Langkawi
    from KL cost RM400 return, caddie fees including 5% of the prize money RM1010, hotel RM500, food RM150, taxis RM120, entry fee RM200, range balls RM42. If my maths is right it's actually ended up costing the player to play in the tournament.</p><p>The less said about the golf the better. We were hitting 5, yes 5 off the first tee...it's a long way back from there!!! tournaments you pay for practice balls on the practice days and get them FOC on tournament days but in Langkawi this week we had to
    pay every day.</p><p>Gunung Raya Golf Resort is a pretty decent layout. Cosmetically it needs some work doing and the course was very dry and bare in a lot of places. The greens were a little bumpy but it's the same for everyone and you just have forget about these things
    and simply focus on playing.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="61"><!-- react-empty: 62 --></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="63"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="64"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="65"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="66"><span data-reactid="67"><!-- react-empty: 68 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="69"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="70">Golf on the mini tours of Asia</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="71"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="72"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="73"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
